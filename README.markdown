# #Trender

Welcome to *#Trender*, this is an android app, designed to do the following:

1. Get the lastest trending topics from *Twitter*.
2. Get the tweets related to a specific trending topic.

This is my first Android app, so there _might_ be some major issues with the code, still it can be usefull for people starting with this technology. 

## Some of the topics covered here are:

1. Multi activity app.
2. Remote connection with JSON objects.
3. Data persistence with the SQLite helpers provided by the SDK.
4. Multi threading.
